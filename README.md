### What is Kubernetes (K8s)?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated to K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

### Kubernetes Architecture

### Why Should We Learn and Use It?

- **Highly flexible**: Kubernetes can run anywhere, from your laptop, to VMs on a cloud provider, to a rack of bare metal servers.
- **Increased efficiency**: With Kubernetes, you can quickly and efficiently respond to customer demand: 
    - Deploy your applications quickly and predictably.
    - Scale your applications on the fly.
    - Roll out new features seamlessly.
    - Limit hardware usage to required resources only.

### Who Is Using Kubernetes?

- Spotify
- Huawei
- IBM
- Pinterest
- eBay
- Shopify
- Squarespace

### Benefits to Business

- **Agility and Speed**: With Kubernetes, businesses can rapidly respond to market changes.
- **Reduced Cost**: Kubernetes makes better use of hardware to maximize resources that are needed to run your enterprise applications.
- **Portability and Flexibility**: Run your applications anywhere without the need to modify the underlying code.
- **Improved Productivity**: Automates various manual processes; managing deployments and scaling is more efficient.

### Kubernetes Objects

- **Pods**: The smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy.
- **Deployments**: A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
- **Services**: An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.
- **ReplicaSets**: Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

### Concept of Labels and Selectors in Kubernetes

**Labels** are key/value pairs attached to objects and can be used to organize and to select subsets of objects. 

**Selectors** allow the user to filter keys based on the labels.
